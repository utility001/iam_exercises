+ However, The user should be able to delete any file in the bucket `spark-job-data-input` in the folder `dumps` except for the files that ends with `csv`.
  + Please use pattern matching to exclude the `csv`.

### Task 2
Using the same user created above, create another custom-policy that will allow the user to only
